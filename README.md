Bank Loan Prediction System
This project is a machine learning-based system to predict whether a bank loan application should be approved or not, based on customer details and historical data.
The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Project Objectives
Predict loan approval status using applicant data.

Explore and preprocess financial datasets for machine learning.

Train and evaluate classification models.

Provide a simple, reproducible workflow for loan prediction tasks.

Features
Data loading and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature encoding for categorical variables

Model training using classification algorithms

Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics

Prediction on new/unseen data

Dataset
Source: Publicly available bank loan dataset (Kaggle or other financial dataset source)

Features: Examples include:

Gender

Married

Dependents

Education

Self_Employed

ApplicantIncome

CoapplicantIncome

LoanAmount

Loan_Amount_Term

Credit_History

Property_Area

Target Variable: Loan Status (Approved / Not Approved)

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Load dataset into Pandas DataFrame

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

Normalize numerical values if needed

Split into train/test sets

2. Model Training
Use classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Fit the model on training data

3. Model Evaluation
Check accuracy score

Generate confusion matrix

Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score

4. Prediction
Take new applicant data

Apply same preprocessing steps

Predict loan approval status
